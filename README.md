# JuanBot
## Objectives:
### 1. Understand how Juan works
Turns out juan uses the XOR gate to win!

He adjusts each line so:
> line3 = line1 XOR line2

You can use a [XOR Calculator](http://xor.pw/) to win him over!
### 2. Develop a bot to beat Juan
bot is currently able to start the game, identify game borders and number of pearls in each row!
